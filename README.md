# Speeduino-DP1600i-
Programmable engine managemnet for the air cooled VW Dual Port 1600 with Mexican EFI OEM parts. The board is a stripped down, "no frills" variant of the official Speeduino V4.4 board with one particular application in mind. A stock, or relatively stock, air cooled VW dual port 1600 engine being converted to EFI using most of the OEM hardware from the Mexican 1600i, and a 36-1 trigger wheel with a VR CKP sensor. It is designed to use waste spark ignition and injectors paired 1&3, 2&4, fired 4 times altenating over the 720 degree engine cycle. The injector pulse is scheduled to be finished when the intake valve reaches the end of its effective duration. With a firing order of 1-4-3-2, half the fuel is injected on an open intake valve, and the other half is injected on a closed intake valve. This should result in a smoother running engine at all speeds and loads as each cylinder gets the same balanced charge mix.

That was the original intent. Now it's growing. Because I had extra real estate on the board, I decided to add some options that may be of use to others.
